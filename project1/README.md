# Project 1 Stress Detect Bun  
## Introduction
This is a stress detection installation. As students, we often experience stress, and recently, squishy toys have become incredibly popular for their stress-relieving properties. This project aims to use the M5 stack as a tool to measure peopleâ€™s stress levels.

## State Diagram
The process begins by checking for input. If input is detected and the count is less than 30, one light on the LED strip will illuminate green. When the input count reaches 30, it triggers a stress emergency status, causing the LED strip to display a red blinking animation. Finally, if the count exceeds 30, it will reset the count and start the process over.

    for _ in range(5):  
        for i in range(30):
            set_led_color(i, 255, 0, 0)  
        time.sleep(0.5)  
        rgb2.fill_color(0x000000)  
        time.sleep(0.5)  
    rgb2.fill_color(0x000000)
