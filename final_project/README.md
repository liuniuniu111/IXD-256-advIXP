# NIUCOZ
## 1. Concept
Using “button (coz)” as a medium to represent a moment in time.

In this case will be the **MORNING**.


## 2. Auditory
As I thinking about the Morning, which will be the time period that I most likely not being awake, it will always reminds me of these four audios:


**1. Bicycle**
<audio src="iphone_alarm.mp3" controls>
**2. Bird Sound**
<audio src="birdsound.mp3" controls>
**3. Alarm**
<audio src="iphone_alarm.mp3" controls>
**4. Sweeping**
<audio src="sweeping.mp3" controls>
